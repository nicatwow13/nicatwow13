# AWS Cognito Setting

## AWS Cognito Overview

Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. Amazon Cognito scales to millions of users and supports sign-in with social identity providers, such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0.

Let’s understand what is AWS Cognito User Pool and AWS Cognito Federal Identity:

- AWS Cognito User Pool
- AWS Cognito Federated Identities

## 2. AWS Cognito Federated Identities

Identity pools are the containers that Cognito Identity uses to keep your apps’ federated identities organized. Identity Pool associates federated identities from social identity providers with a unique user-specific identifier. Identity Pools do not store any user profiles. An identity pool can be associated with one or many apps. If you use two different identity pools for two apps then the same end user will have a different unique identifier in each Identity Pool.

- Click a Create new identity pool button as shown in the below screenshot.
